Using these single-cell assays, numerous questions about the heterogeneity of single-cell populations can now be addressed. Unfortunately, there is a lack of computational tools to take full advantage of these new technologies. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a computational framework that enables unbiased polyfunctionality analysis of antigen-specific T-cell subsets. COMPASS uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework to model all observed functional cell-subsets simultaneously, and selects the subsets most likely to exhibit an antigen-specific response, while regularizing the small cell counts that often arise in multi-parameter space. The cell-subset responses are quantified by a set of posterior probabilities, which can be used to profile a subject’s immune response such as to infection or vaccination. We introduce two novel summary statistics that can be correlated directly with a clinical outcome, and describe the quality of an individual’s functional or polyfunctional response across cell-subsets. Using three clinical datasets of cytokine production after vaccination, or in people infected with latent tuberculosis, we demonstrate how COMPASS improves the characterization of antigen-specific T-cells and unveils findings missed by traditional analyses. In particular, COMPASS identifies novel, previously unknown, cellular correlates of protection in the RV144 HIV efficacy trial. COMPASS is available as open-source software that provides an implementation of the model described here as well as a web-based visualization framework for viewing results.\r\n\r\n## Shiny Application\r\n\r\nShiny is an R package that allows users to develop web applications powered by R. The `COMPASS` package is distributed with a function, `shinyCOMPASS`, that allows users to easily visualize the results of a `COMPASS` model fit. With this, users can easily and interactively explore the results of a `COMPASS` fit in their browser, started directly from an R session.\r\n\r\nExamples of the `COMPASS` Shiny application are available here:\r\n\r\n- [http://turn.fhcrc.org/HVTN078/](HVTN078)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
